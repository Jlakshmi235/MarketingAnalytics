    "The null hypothesis for this test was whether there is a difference in registration rate between the 3 pictures shown to customers. According to this test, the null hypothesis is rejected because there is a signficant difference. The p value is extremely low so there is a low chance that the null hypothesis is true."

    "We have conducted t-tests as well as a chi-squared test in order to determine the best picture to show to potential customers through email marketing. \n",
    "\n",
    "First we looked at the site duration variable and tested out whether there was a signficant difference in the site duration for each of the pictures shown. We conducted 3 statistical t-tests in order to determine what picture had the highest signficant site duration amoung customers. The null hypothesis for each of the tests was that there was no signficant difference in the site duration based on the picture. The alternative hypthesis was that when shown one picture, people had a signficantly higher site duration than the people who were shown the other picture. In both the t tests where the \"Chili Peppers\" picture was compared to the other 2, the null hypothesis was rejected which means that the people who were shown the \"Chili Peppers\" picture had a significantly longer site duration than the people who were shown 1 of the other 2 pictures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we looked at the spend variable and tested out whether there was a signficant difference in the spending between the different pictures shown. We conducted 3 statistical t-tests in order to determine what picture was associated with the highest spending amoung customers. The null hypothesis for each of the tests was that there was no signficant difference in the spend variable based on the picture. The alternative hypthesis was that when shown one picture, people spent signficantly more  than the people who were shown the other picture. In both the t tests where the \"Chili Peppers\" picture was compared to the other 2, the null hypothesis was rejected which means that the people who were shown the \"Chili Peppers\" picture spent significantly more than the people who were shown 1 of the other 2 pictures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we conducted a Chi-Squared test to determine if there was a difference in the registration rate between the different pictures shown. The null hypothesis was that picture does not impact the likelihood of registration. The null hypothesis was rejected based on the results of this Chi-squared test. The p-value was extremely low which indicates that the probability that the null is true is low. The highest amount of registrations is associated with the \"Billie\" picture since 476 people registered after seeing that picture in the promotional email. \n",
    "\n",
    "After interpreting our results from these tests, we decided to recommend to Lobster Land that it would be best for them to send emails containing the Chili Peppers picture since that picture is associated with longer site duration as well as higher site spending for customers. We believe that the Chili Peppers picture provides the most value for their marketing campaign out of the 3 pictures.  \n",
